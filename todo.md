# Introduction
This file outlines the plans and progress of the version two (2.0) development of the Mail-admin panel project.

# Improvements to make over version one
* Improve the overall UI for global admins, domain admins and users.
* Support both SQL and LDAP backends (but maybe not right away)
* Ditch the Microsoft 365 UI and focus on what Exchange 2019 does as we only need to worry about mail
* Simple group management, no CSV values.
* RestAPI
* Two-Factor Authentication
* User policies
* Support for Nextcloud integration.
* Shared function calls (for both UI and API)
